# Webhooks in Sequence Builder

Sequence Builder equips game builders with an indexer that listens to events across the many blockchains that we offer by providing an https callback

<Callout type='warning'>
	If you prefer a programmatic way to add webhooks that uses cURL, TypeScript or Go, check out [this walkthrough](/api/indexer/examples/webhook-listener).

#### What data can I listen to for my game?
- Mints from a contract
- TokenID transfers
- Transactions by an account address
- Event topics emitted by a contract
- Event topic hashes emitted by a contract

## Creating Webhooks

The following steps guide you through creating your webhook

1. [Select Project and go to Webhooks Section](/solutions/builder/webhooks#select-project-and-go-to-webhooks-section)
2. [Select Network and Add New Webhook](/solutions/builder/webhooks#select-network-and-add-new-webhook)
2. [Complete Webhook Details](/solutions/builder/webhooks#complete-webhook-details)

::::steps
### Select Project and go to Webhooks Section

Select your project in the top left hand corner, select the `Indexer` section in the sidebar, and select the `Webhooks` tab.

### Select Network and Add New Webhook

In the dropdown beneath the webhooks tab, select the network you're looking to create a webhook for based on the ones in your project. If you don't see the network you're looking for, you can always [add a network](/support/builder/project-settings#3-network-settings), then `+ Add New Webhook`

### Complete Webhook Details
Complete the required details like webhook `URL`, `Contract Address(es)`, and 'Events'. 

For the Events field, we are able to parse any arbitrary contract event, however you must input the event exactly as written in your smart contract. For example, for detecting transfer events you would input: `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount)` with the `indexed` keyword. You can find an example of general event types [here](/api/indexer/examples/webhook-listener#on-chain-token-event-types) for common use cases along with Sequence specific ones.

 
 
Once your desired fields are input, select `Add Webhook`. 



<Callout type="info">
    If you require a webhook endpoint you can use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)
    
    Or, you can use template code with one of the following:

    [Nodejs TypeScript Webhook](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/template-nodejs-webhook-server) (combined with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/))
</Callout>
