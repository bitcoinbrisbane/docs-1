# Wallet Linking Integration Guide

In this guide, we will showcase how to sign into an Embedded Wallet using traditional authentication like email or social login. A verifiable link is generated from the session which redirects a user to separate application to sign into an external wallet via [Sequence Kit](/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/overview). We will then showcase how to create a link via a backend to server storage with the Embedded Wallet account from the authorized frontend web session.

This feature is very useful for when users are being onboarded with Embedded Wallets, with prior history and assets in external wallets. This architecture enables read-access of multiple linked wallets to perform querying of inventory, leaving assets in respective wallets untouched as well as enhancing the ability from liquidity or funds to flow from external wallets to wallets associated with a game.

<Callout type="info">
 The full templated code can be found in the respective repositories if you would like to start integration right away:
  - [Template WaaS Auth](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-waas-auth/blob/master/src/components/views/EOALinkView.tsx) - Logic associated with the embedded wallet for generating verifiable a link.
  - [Template WaaS Wallet Link](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/demo-waas-wallet-link) - Application user is redirected to link their external account and view assets in their wallets.
  - The end to end example can be tested from this [Wallet Linking Demo](https://0xsequence.github.io/demo-waas-auth/) where at the bottom of the screen, select the card titled "EOA Link".

## Wallet Linking Diagram Flow

![wallet linking guide sequence diagram](/img/guides/wallet-linking/wallet-linking-diagram.png)

## 1. Sequence Builder Console Signup & Project Creation

First start by following [this walkthrough](/support/builder/project-management) for how to sign up to the [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/) and to learn how to create a project.

## 2. Access Key Management

Now that you have a project, you'll need to acquire 2 different Access Keys for your project in order to authenticate your application with the Sequence Stack:
1. `Waas Config Key` used for the Embedded Wallet, which can be learned about [here](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet).
2. `Project Access Key` used for the Embedded Wallet, Sequence Kit, & Sequence Indexer, which can be done [here](/solutions/builder/getting-started#claim-an-api-access-key).

<Callout type="info">
For this guide, while you're configuring your Embedded Wallet, in order to generate signatures a Parent Wallet will have to be deployed. You can learn about this [here](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/examples/verification#prerequisite-deployment-of-a-parent-wallet).
</Callout>

## 3. Embedded Wallet Integration

<Callout type="info">
You can view and clone the template repository [here](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/template-embedded-wallet-web2-auth) for the Embedded Wallet sign in
</Callout>

We'll start from scratch building up the project with the necessary pieces, to enable the use of a Sequence Embedded Wallet so users are onboarded to your application using web2 authentication providers.

First start by creating a project folder with `mkdir <project>`, then `cd <project>` and create a `vite` project using React:

```shell
pnpm create vite

# or 
yarn create vite

# or 
npm create vite
```

Next, we'll install the Wallet-as-a-Service (Waas) package to use the Embedded Wallet:

```shell
pnpm install @0xsequence/waas

# or
npm install @0xsequence/waas

# or
yarn add @0xsequence/waas
```

For all of the new files created in the follows steps, have them be created in `/src`

First, create a file called something like `SequenceEmbeddedWallet.ts` with the following initialization code:

```typescript
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const sequence = new SequenceWaaS({
    projectAccessKey: import.meta.env.VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY!,
    waasConfigKey:  import.meta.env.VITE_WAAS_CONFIG_KEY!,
    network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})

export default sequence;
```

Then create another file called `useSessionHash.ts` that generates a session hash from the SDK unique to the user, which can be imported and used as a React hook:

```typescript
import sequence from './SequenceEmbeddedWallet.ts'
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export function useSessionHash() {
    const [sessionHash, setSessionHash] = useState("")
    const [error, setError] = useState<any>(undefined)

    useEffect(() => {
        const handler = async () => {
            try {
                setSessionHash(await sequence.getSessionHash())
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error)
                setError(error)
            }
        }
        handler()
        return sequence.onSessionStateChanged(handler)
    }, [setSessionHash, setError])

    return {
        sessionHash,
        error,
        loading: !!sessionHash,
    }
}
```

Finally, to implement Google auth, you will need the `GoogleOAuthProvider`. The following command will install the provider as well as the Apple Auth sign in, which will be used later:

```shell
pnpm i @react-oauth/google react-apple-signin-auth
```

<Callout type="warning">
Apple authentication can not be used with localhost applications, so to test you'll need to deploy your application and update the `Allowed Origins` for the bundle id.
</Callout>

Then, the starter code is implemented with the previous imported files, in the following code within the `main.tsx` file, where the `GoogleOAuthProvider` wraps the application, where the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is obtained from the Google Developer Console. More on this [here](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet/google-configuration):

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App.tsx'
import { useSessionHash } from "./useSessionHash.ts";

import { GoogleOAuthProvider } from '@react-oauth/google'


function Dapp() {
  const { sessionHash } = useSessionHash()

  return (
	<GoogleOAuthProvider clientId="<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>" nonce={sessionHash} key={sessionHash}>
		<App />
	</GoogleOAuthProvider>
  );
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Dapp />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

Once your `main.tsx` is ready, lets create the login buttons, which will look like this:

![embedded wallet social login](/img/guides/treasure-chest/guide_treasure_chest_embedded_wallet_template.png)

In `App.tsx` use the following code that checks to see if a user is connected and presents a wallet address based on the signed in user, with the various social auth buttons and handlers:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import sequence from './SequenceEmbeddedWallet'
import { useSessionHash } from './useSessionHash'
import { CredentialResponse, GoogleLogin } from '@react-oauth/google';
import AppleSignin from 'react-apple-signin-auth';

function LoginScreen () {
  const { sessionHash } = useSessionHash()

  const [wallet, setWallet] = useState<any>(null)

  const handleGoogleLogin = async (tokenResponse: CredentialResponse) => {
    const res = await sequence.signIn({
      idToken: tokenResponse.credential! // inputted id credential from google
    }, "template")
    setWallet(res.wallet)
  }

  const handleAppleLogin = async (response: any) => {
    const res = await sequence.signIn({
      idToken: response.authorization.id_token! // inputted id token from apple
    }, "template")
 
    setWallet(res.wallet)
  }

  // checks to see if there is a logged in user
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(async () => {
      if(await sequence.isSignedIn()){
        setWallet(await sequence.getAddress())
      }
    }, 0)
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {

  }, [wallet])

  const signOut = async () => {
    try {
      const sessions = await sequence.listSessions()

      for(let i = 0; i < sessions.length; i++){
        await sequence.dropSession({ sessionId: sessions[i].id })
      }
    }catch(err){
      console.log(err)
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      {
        !wallet 
      ? 
        <>
          <span className='sign-in-via'>SIGN IN VIA</span>

          <br/>
          <br/>
          <div className="login-container">
          <div className='dashed-box-google'>
              <p className='content'>
                <div className='gmail-login' style={{overflow: 'hidden', opacity: '0', width: '90px', position: 'absolute', zIndex: 1, height: '100px'}}>
                  <GoogleLogin 
                    nonce={sessionHash}
                    key={sessionHash}

                  </div>
                  <span className='gmail-login'>Gmail</span>
              </p>
          </div>
          <div className='dashed-box-apple'>
            <p className='content' 
            style={{position:'relative'}}>
                <span className='apple-login'>
                  {/* @ts-ignore */}
                  <AppleSignin
                    key={sessionHash}
                    authOptions={{
                      clientId: '<replce with com. bundle id>',
                      scope: 'openid email',
                      redirectURI: '<must be a deployed URL>',
                      usePopup: true,
                      nonce: sessionHash
                    }}
                    onError={(error: any) => console.error(error)}
                    onSuccess={handleAppleLogin}
                  />Apple
                </span>
            </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </>
      : 
        <>
          <div className="login-container">
          <p style={{cursor: 'pointer'}} onClick={() =>signOut()}>sign out</p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <span >{wallet}</span>
          </div>
        </>
      }
    </>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <LoginScreen/>
  )
}

export default App
```

Then, include a `.env` file in the root of your project, adding it to `.gitignore`, and updating the file with the following values from the Sequence Builder:

```
VITE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY=
VITE_WAAS_CONFIG_KEY=
```

<Callout type="warning">
All environment variables must start with `VITE_` to be included in the environment of a vite application
</Callout>

Run your code with the following command in the root folder and give it a try:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

<Callout type="danger">
In order to allow for a custom sign in page without the Web2 widgets, you'll need to actually hide the standard sign-in buttons from the recommended npm packages. It is best to just copy and paste the whole `App.css` [found here](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/template-embedded-wallet-web2-auth/blob/master/src/App.css) and include it in your code that has the correct css classes.
</Callout>

## 4. Deploy a Cloudflare Worker with KV Storage

In order to create the Cloudflare worker project from scratch, first create a project with `mkdir`, `cd` into the project, and run `pnpm init` to create a `package.json`.

Next, make sure wrangler cli is installed in your project and set the `wrangler` keyword as an alias in your local bash session.

```shell
pnpm install wrangler --save-dev
alias wrangler='./node_modules/.bin/wrangler'
```

Create an account on the [Cloudflare site](https://cloudflare.com/) and perform a login step to login to your Cloudflare dashboard to connect the Cloudflare platform to your local development environment.

```shell
wrangler login
```

Once logged in, initialize the project in the directory by accepting one of the randomly generated project folder names provided that you like, and follow the prompts to initialize your git tracked typescript `"Hello World" Worker` application.

```shell
wrangler init
```

To complete this step, you should press enter 4 times after `wrangler init` with the last 2 steps answered as `No` to decline git versioning and deployment.

This will clone down a starter repository that can be used to deploy code to the cloud.

<Callout type='info'>
Local API Testing <br/>
At any point in the guide, you can use the `wrangler dev` command in the project folder for local testing
</Callout>

#### Deploy Test

Next, `cd` into the randomly generated project folder, and perform a `wrangler deploy` command.

This should print a URL, which you can enter in the browser the URL `https://<app>.<account>.workers.dev` to view the `Hello World!` result.

#### Add a Key-Value Storage Environment Object

For this guide, we will enable the system to store data in a Key-Value (KV) storage environment object. To start we will create a single variable that stores just a single nonce based on new requests.

Add the following to the top of your `index.ts` file:

```typescript
export interface Env {
    waas_wallet_link_db: KVNamespace;
}
```

Then in the rest of your code include the following testing code to generate a valid nonce that is stored.

First, install ethers with the following command:

```shell
pnpm install ethers@5.7.2
```

Then use the following code:

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

...

async function handleRequest(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    if (request.method === "OPTIONS") {
            return new Response(null, {
                headers: {
                    // Allow requests from any origin - adjust this as necessary
                    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
                    
                    // Allow POST method - add any other methods you need to support
                    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET",
                    
                    // Optional: allow credentials
                    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
                    
                    // Preflight cache period
                    "Access-Control-Max-Age": "86400", // 24 hours
                }
            });
    }

    const nonce = ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.utils.randomBytes(32))
	await env.waas_wallet_link_db.put('NONCE', String(nonce))
    
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({nonce: await env.waas_wallet_link_db.get('NONCE')}), {
        status: 200,
    });
}

export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
        // Process the request and create a response
        const response = await handleRequest(request, env, ctx);

        // Set CORS headers
        response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST, GET, OPTIONS");
        response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type");

        // return response
        return response;
    }
}
```
Then, you'll need to create a namespace for your variable, which can be done with the following cli command:

```shell
wrangler kv:namespace create waas_wallet_link_db
```

Then, you'll need to add the generated namespace id to your `wrangler.toml`

For example:

```shell
kv_namespaces = [
    { binding = "waas_wallet_link_db", id = "<YOUR_GENERATED_ID>" }
]
```

Finally, deploy your worker with `wrangler deploy` and enter in the browser the URL `https://<app>.<account>.workers.dev` to view the nonce stored.

## 5. Nonce Generation

Now that we have an application that can log in a user and a Cloudflare worker that can receive requests to generate a simple nonce, let's create the structure of the worker to both generate a nonce for a wallet address, store it, and later verify the nonce using the Sequence API.

To generate a nonce, use the following code that handles a POST with the `walletAddress` passed in the body:

```typescript

export interface Env {
    ...
    VERIFICATION_URL: string;
    ...
}

...

async function handleRequest(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    ...
    let url = new URL(request.url)

    if (url.pathname === "/generateNonce") {
        const payload = await request.json()
        const { walletAddress }: any = payload

        if (!walletAddress) {
            return new Response(null, {
                status: 400,
                statusText: "Bad Request",
            });
        }

        // generate a random nonce
        const nonce = ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.utils.randomBytes(32))

        // store the nonce
        await env.waas_wallet_link_db.put(nonce, walletAddress)

        return new Response(JSON.stringify({
            nonce: nonce,
            verificationUrl: env.VERIFICATION_URL
        }), {
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
        });
    }
}
```

And for this demo, set the `VERIFICATION_URL` in your `wrangler.toml`, which will be used to reference your app. 

```shell
VERIFICATION_URL = '<SECOND_APP_URL>' # e.g. http://localhost:5174
```

In the future, for maximal optionality this `VERIFICATION_URL` can always be changed on the fly to redirect your user to a different location with "behind-the-scenes" redeployments of your Cloudflare Worker.

To run a test, redploy with `wrangler deploy`, and call the function with:

```shell
curl -X POST https://<app>.<account>.workers.dev -d '{"walletAddress": "<wallet_address>"}'
```

After a successful response, integrate into the frontend with the following code attached to a button click handler:

```typescript
const generateNonce = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/generateNonce`, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ walletAddress })
    });
}
...
<button onClick={() => generateNonce()}>
```

You'll need to store the returned nonce response in the frontend to be able to be used in a subsequent request to verify.

## 6. Embedded Wallet Verification

Returning to the Cloudflare Worker, create a statement block with the following code to handle the path of `/verifyNonce` that checks that all variables are passed correctly:

```typescript
async function handleRequest(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    ...
    if (url.pathname === "/verifyNonce") {
        const payload = await request.json()
        const { nonce, signature, sessionId, chainId }: any = payload

        if (!nonce || !signature || !sessionId || !chainId) {
            return new Response(null, {
                status: 400,
                statusText: "Bad Request",
            });
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

Then, get the `walletAddress` stored from before using the `nonce`:

```typescript
  if (url.pathname === "/verifyNonce") {
    ...
    let walletAddress = await env.waas_wallet_link_db.get(nonce)

    if (!walletAddress) {
        return new Response(null, {
            status: 404,
            statusText: "Not Found",
        });
    }
    ...
  }
```

Reconstruct the `authProof` with the following string:

```typescript
const authProof = `SessionAuthProof ${sessionId} ${walletAddress} ${nonce}`
```

And verify the `authProof` using the sequence API (installed with `pnpm install 0xsequence`), handling the case where the signature is not valid, and returning the `walletAddress` when the signature is valid:

```typescript
import { sequence } from "0xsequence"

export interface Env {
    ...
    PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY: string;
    ...
}
...

let api = new sequence.api.SequenceAPIClient(
    "https://api.sequence.app",
    env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY
)

let isValid = await api.isValidMessageSignature({
    walletAddress: walletAddress,
    message: authProof,
    signature: signature,
    chainId: chainId
})

if (!isValid) {
    return new Response(null, {
        status: 401,
        statusText: "Unauthorized",
    });
} else {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({
        walletAddress
    }), {
        status: 200,
        statusText: "OK",
    });
}

```

And, with the `wrangler.toml` updated with the project access key, the `node_compat` variable set to `true`, and the `compatibility_flags` variable removed:

```shell
node_compat = true
...
PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY = '<PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY_FROM_BUILDER>'
...
```

Great, the backend Cloudflare worker is complete. Deploy again with `wrangler deploy` and now it's time to create an Embedded Wallet Signature from the frontend to test verification works.

## 7. Embedded Wallet Signature

In your frontend code, you'll need to generate a signature, which can be done with the following code passing in the nonce generated from before and the network name chain handle:

<Callout type="info"> 
The `network` value is the network name in plain text e.g. `mainnet`, `avalanche`, `base`, etc. sourced from the [Sequence Networks Status Page](https://status.sequence.info/) for the network you chose in the Sequence Builder.
</Callout>

```typescript
const authProof = await sequence.sessionAuthProof({ 
    nonce, 
    network
})

const sessionId = authProof.data.sessionId
const signature = authProof.data.signature
```

Where the `sequence` variable is the Embedded Wallet authorized object imported from the `SequenceEmbeddedWallet.ts` file we created prior.

### Produce Verification Link for Wallet Linking app

Once you have the variables required to verify a session, the variables are passed in a URL to redirect your users to the Wallet Linking app, which will be parsed to verify a session so that an EOA can be used to sign in.

To construct the URL, use the base `VERIFICATION_URL` from [step 5](/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/integration-guide#5-nonce-generation) link as the domain, and append the necessary variables using URL query params using the following code:

```typescript
const externalNonce = nonce
const authProofSignature = signature
const authProofSessionId = sessionId
const chainId = 'arbitrum-nova'
const verificationLink = `${verificationUrl}?nonce=${externalNonce}&signature=${authProofSignature}&sessionId=${authProofSessionId}&chainId=${chainId}`
```

And prompt the verification link to the user to redirect using something like an `a` Anchor HTML element:

```html
<a href={verificationLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Authorized Session App
</a>
```

## 8. Sequence Kit Login for External Wallet Authentication

In the second dapp, follow the provided walkthrough [here](/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/getting-started#getting-started-with-sequence-kit) to create an application that enables users to sign in with an Externally-Owned Account (EOA) using Metamask, or, a Coinbase wallet, where the `VERIFICATION_URL` from [step 5](/solutions/wallets/link-wallets/integration-guide#5-nonce-generation) links to for this 2nd app.

### verifyNonce

Once the app with Sequence Kit is set up, and the URL has all the verification parameters passed in, parse the URL and call the `/verifyNonce` endpoint and pass with the variables of the `nonce` we generated prior, `sessionId` from the Embedded Wallet hook, `signature`, and `chainId` to your Cloudflare Worker, where the `chainId` is the number for the network you're dealing with:

```typescript
const nonce: string | null = urlParams.get("nonce");
const signature: string | null = urlParams.get("signature");
const sessionId: string | null = urlParams.get("sessionId");
const chainId: string | null = urlParams.get("chainId");
```

Then, make a call to the Cloudflare Worker performed as:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/verifyNonce`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({nonce, signature, chainId, sessionId})
});
```

The Embedded Wallet from the first application should be returned successfully. After this, change the UI to accomodate the additional flow for signing in a user with an external wallet.

## 9. Query Balances across Wallets

Once you have an application with at least 2 signed in wallet addresses, you can use the Sequence Indexer to query multiple balances and aggregate balances based on the `contractAddress` returned from the Indexer. 

This can be accomplished with the following function and example after you've downloaded the Indexer with `pnpm @0xsequence/indexer`:

```typescript
import {SequenceIndexer} from '@0xsequence/indexer'
...
const multiQuery = async (addresses: string[]) => {
    const indexer = new SequenceIndexer('https://<CHAIN_HANDLE>-indexer.sequence.app', 'AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY');

    const balancePromises: any = addresses.map(accountAddress => 
        indexer.getTokenBalances({
            accountAddress: accountAddress,
            includeMetadata: true
        })
    );

    const results:any = await Promise.all(balancePromises);
    
    // Aggregate the balances
    const aggregatedBalances = results.reduce((acc: any, result: any) => {
        result.balances.forEach((balance: any) => {
            const existingBalance = acc.find((b: any) => b.contractAddress === balance.contractAddress);
            if (existingBalance) {
                existingBalance.balance = (Number(existingBalance.balance) + Number(balance.balance)).toString();
            } else {
                // Convert balance to string as the balance is being stored in that format
                balance.balance = balance.balance.toString();
                acc.push(balance);
            }
        });
        return acc;
    }, []);

    return aggregatedBalances;
};

const query = async () => {
    const res = await multiQuery([<wallet_address>, <wallet_address>]);
    console.log('Aggregated token balances:', res);
};
```

### Conclusion

To sum up, we've created an application to authenticate a user, instantiate a non-custodial embedded wallet, and create a cryptographically verifiable URL. This verifiable URL links to another application that validates the previous embedded wallet session and enables a user to connect any external wallet. This relationship is stored in a backend of your choosing, in this case, Cloudflare to retrieve or query at a later time.

While we utilized web technologies for the embedded wallet application, this same logic can be easily extended to Unity, Unreal, or any other framework to create the same verifiable link from nearly any platform.
