# Fiat On-ramps

Sequence Wallet allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies directly with their credit card and debit card via on-ramp providers. Currently Sequence supports 6 on-ramp providers;

- [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/)
- [Ramp](https://ramp.network/)
- [Transak](https://www.transak.com/)
- [PayTrie](https://paytrie.com/)

Only providers that support the region the users are in will be displayed.

As a developer integrating the Sequence Wallet, you can choose which payment provider can be visible to users. You can also specify which token will be available to purchase via the on-ramp providers.

To learn more on how to configure the on-ramp options, see [Sequence Connect Options](/solutions/wallets/universal-wallet/examples/connect-wallet#wallet-login-and-connect-options).

## On-ramp Integrations with Sequence Kit

The [Sequence Kit SDK](/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/overview) offers the support for using [Transak](https://transak.com/) to on-ramp users with a fiat credit or debit card using a simplified react hook component.

More on this can be found [here](/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/on-ramp)
