# Transaction Manager

The Sequence Transaction Manager offers a simple interface for dispatching transactions on Ethereum-compatible networks to service your game or app and scale to millions of users that brings an enormous amount of [benefits](/api/transactions/overview#benefits).

The only difference with respect to deployed EVM contracts: transactions with a Sequence Transaction Manager will have the `msg.sender` as one of the Sequence Relayer addresses, which can be seen in any one of the status pages: for example [here on mainnet](https://mainnet-relayer.sequence.app/status) with the `senders` array.

## Quickstart

### Try your own Deployable Template 

::::steps
#### Access Railway Template

Try out the Transaction Manager with [your own deployed template](https://railway.app/template/EzeuAo)

#### Sequence Builder Project Management

Create a project using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started).

What network you assign to the project should be used for `CHAIN_HANDLE`. 

See [Chain Support](/solutions/technical-references/chain-support). 

#### Access Key Management

Obtain a Project Access Key using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started#claim-an-api-access-key).

This should be used for `PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY`.

#### Deploy an ERC1155 or ERC721 Collectible Contract

Deploy a collectible contract by following this [walkthrough](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-an-item-collection).

This contract should be used for `COLLECTIBLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

#### Complete Railway Template Variables
Use all the values from the previous steps to complete and deploy the online template with the `Deploy` button.

#### Update Exposed Port in Interface
Access settings for your deployment and update the exposed port to `3000`:

##### Generate Domain
![update exposed port](/img/payments/transaction_manager_service_deployed_generate_domain.png)

##### Set Port
![update exposed port](/img/payments/transaction_manager_deployed_set_port_generate_domain.png)

#### Perform a Mint Transaction

Using a command line interface, call using cURL to mint to a wallet address:

```shell
curl -X POST https://<DEPLOYED_RAILWAY_URL>/mint \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"evmAddress": "<EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS>", "tokenID": "<TOKEN_ID>", "contractAddress":"<COLLECTIBLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>", "isERC1155": "<true_OR_false>", "amount":<AMOUNT> }'
```

Input an `EVM wallet address`, `token ID`, `collectible contract address` (either a Sequence Builder ERC721 or ERC1155), `true` or `false` for `isERC1155`, and the `amount` of tokens to transfer into the above request and mint!

You should recieve a response with a `txHash`:

```shell
{"txHash":"<TX_HASH>"}
```

<Callout type='info'>
The Transaction Manager template will accept requests from all origins.

## Template Source Code

Want to further customize and take your code to production? There's a single step to make this production ready for Web applications:

### Restrict Origin from a Frontend Code

Update the following line of code from `*` to include the `requesting origin domain` of the deployed application in the following [line of code.](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/tx-manager/blob/master/server/server.ts#L44)

:::info
Get started quickly with the source code of the [template](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/tx-manager) using the Transactions API.
