# Transactions Manager

The Sequence Transactions Manager offers a simple interface for dispatching transactions on Ethereum-compatible networks to service your game or app and scale to millions of users that brings with it an enormous amount of [benefits](/api/transactions/overview#benefits).

The best part: transactions with Sequence Transaction Manager are compatible with any existing/deployed Ethereum contract, and thus, integrating the Sequence Transactions Manager doesn't require any changes to your contracts or dapp. 

## Quickstart

### Try your own Deployable Template 

::::steps
#### Access Railway Template

Try out the Transactions Manager with [your own deployed template](https://railway.app/template/ERJVm2)

#### Sequence Builder Project Management

Create a project using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started).

What network you assign to the project should be used for `CHAIN_HANDLE`. 

See [Chain Support](/solutions/technical-references/chain-support). 

#### Access Key Management

Obtain a Project Access Key using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started#claim-an-api-access-key).

This should be used for `PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY`.

#### Deploy an ERC1155 or ERC721 Collectible Contract

Deploy a collectible contract by following this [walkthrough](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-an-item-collection).

This contract should be used for `COLLECTIBLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

#### Complete Railway Template Variables
Use all the values from the previous steps to complete and deploy the online template with the `Deploy` button.

#### Update Exposed Port in Interface
Access settings for your deployment and update the exposed port to `3000`:

##### Generate Domain
![update exposed port](/img/payments/transactions_api_service_deployed_generate_domain.png)

##### Set Port
![update exposed port](/img/payments/transactions_api_service_deployed_set_port_generate_domain.png)

#### Perform a Mint Transaction

Using a command line interface, call using cURL to mint to a wallet address:

```shell
curl -X POST http://<YOUR_URL>/mint \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"evmAddress": "<EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS>", "tokenID": "<TOKEN_ID>"}'
```

Input a `wallet address` and `token ID` into the above request and mint!

You should recieve a response with a `txHash`:

```shell
{"txHash":"<TX_HASH>"}
```

<Callout type='info'>
The backend Transactions Manager template will accept requests from all origins.
