# Installation


1) Once you have the `SequencePlugin` folder, you'll need to go to your project directory and create a `Plugins` folder in it,
   then copy over the `SequencePlugin` folder into the `Plugins` folder. If a `Plugins` folder already exists just copy the `SequencePlugin` folder into it.

2) Launch your project, then allow it to update the UProject Settings.

3) To find the `SequencePlugin` content folder in your content drawer enable view plugin content
