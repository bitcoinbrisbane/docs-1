# Built-In GUI

## Before Starting:

You can simply duplicate the `[BP_CustomSpectatorPawn]` but since it and its parent class reside within the realm of the plugin, during updates all modifications you make within the plugin could potentially be lost. These are here as a reference for how things should be done. We recommend you duplicate the `BP_CustomSpectatorPawn` out of the plugin folder, then update its parent class to a C++ class of your own making that also resides outside the plugins content folder.

Some additional setup of the GameMode will need to be done prior to any UI showing up. The SequencePlugin comes bundled with an example GameMode `[GM_Sequence]` stored within `[Demonstration]` in the plugin content folder. Duplicate this GameMode and move it outside the plugin folder. Then open up `[GM_Sequence]` and set the DefaultPawn to the Pawn Blueprint you've just made.

Lastly in Project Settings you'll need to set this GameMode as the default GameMode. Specifically in `ProjectSettings -> Maps & Modes`

### **If you wish to use the in built sequence UI for login you have to do the following:**

a) Create a **C++ Class** that Inherits from `[Pawn]`. If you don't know how to do this refer to the doc Creating C++ Classes in Unreal, for the purpose of these docs I'll refer to the C++ Class created here as the **[C++ Parent]**

b) In **[C++ Parent]** .h file include the Header `[Sequence/SequenceAPI.h]` this will allow you to access the `[USequenceWallet]`

c) Create a BlueprintCallable function within the **[C++ Parent]** that accepts `[FCredentials_BE]` as a Parameter.

d) Create a Blueprint that inherits from **[C++ Parent]**, Then Attach the following Actor component to it `[AC_SequencePawn_Component]`. For in depth specifics on how to setup this blueprint please refer to the demonstration BP Graph Image, this is the BP Graph of `[BP_CustomSpectatorPawn]` contained within the plugins content folder, & serves as a template for your own Blueprint graph.

The important part here is forwarding the Credentials received from the inbuilt UI to your **[C++ Parent]** by binding to the delegate from `[AC_SequencePawn_Component]`, that gives you Credentials `[Auth_Success_Forwarder]` & Calling your Blueprint Callable C++ function. You can do this by swapping the *SetupCredentials* BlueprintCallable Function for your own Blueprint Callable Function from **[C++ Parent]**.

#### Additional:

For those who aren't familiar with Unreal's Blueprint system you can create a blueprint by right clicking in the content drawer, then click blueprint class. Within the blueprint class selector select the All Classes dropdown & search for your **[C++ Parent]** class you just made.

For those who aren't familiar with Unreal's delegate system, There will be a red empty box on a delegate you'll wish to bind to. Click on this box and drag out into the blueprint editor. From the menu that appears Click the Add Event dropdown then click add custom event.

#### Take away notes on setup

This isn't the only way you can setup the **Builtin GUI**, this is here as a quick start reference for those just getting started with Unreal.

### Customizing the built-in GUI

In the folder located at *All/Plugins/SequencePlugin Content/Core/Style* you'll find a struct `F_SequenceUIStyle`, In the default values section of this struct you'll be able to update the colours and images displayed throughout the UI. For beta we currently only read from Sequence_Style_Dark_Mode
