# Authentication

## Built-In UI

### Before Starting:

You can simply duplicate the `[BP_CustomSpectatorPawn]` but since it and its parent class reside within the realm of the plugin, during updates all modifications you make within the plugin could potentially be lost. These are here as a reference for how things should be done. We recommend you duplicate the `BP_CustomSpectatorPawn` out of the plugin folder, then update its parent class to a C++ class of your own making that also resides outside the plugins content folder.

Some additional setup of the GameMode will need to be done prior to any UI showing up. The SequencePlugin comes bundled with an example GameMode `[GM_Sequence]` stored within `[Demonstration]` in the plugin content folder. Duplicate this GameMode and move it outside the plugin folder. Then open up `[GM_Sequence]` and set the DefaultPawn to the Pawn Blueprint you've just made.

Lastly in Project Settings you'll need to set this GameMode as the default GameMode. Specifically in `ProjectSettings -> Maps & Modes`

Try running your project now! You should be able to log in using your social credentials if you've set everything up correctly so far!

### Customizing the built-in UI

In the folder located at *SequencePlugin Content/Core/Style* you'll find a struct `F_SequenceUIStyle`. In the default values section of this struct you'll be able to update the colours and images displayed throughout the UI. Currently we only read from `Sequence_Style_Dark_Mode`

## Custom UI Integration

In a C++ **UObject** with a series of pass through `[UFUNCTIONS]` setup similarly to `[SequenceBackendManager.h/.cpp]`. Each of these calls are implemented in `[UAuthenticator]` you just need to pass through the data with **YOUR** UAuthenticator UObject

```cpp
/*
   Used to initiate mobile Social Signin
   (No other calls need to be made to complete mobile SSO)
*/
void InitiateMobileSSO(const ESocialSigninType& Type)
/*
   Optional Call,
   Used to set a custom encryptor implementation for the Authentication Process
*/
void SetCustomEncryptor(UGenericNativeEncryptor * EncryptorIn);
/*
   This call is for generating a login URL for Desktop based Social Signin
   the received URL is fed into a WebBrowser to begin the login process
*/
FString GetLoginURL(const ESocialSigninType& Type); 
/*
   This is call is for undergoing social login once an ID_Token has been collected.
*/
void SocialLogin(const FString& IDTokenIn);
/*
   This Call is made after you've collected the email address from the Users in the UI
   The Delegate **[AuthRequiresCode]** will fire when a code is ready to be received
   by the UAuthenticator
*/
void EmailLogin(const FString& EmailIn);
/*
   This is call is made after the Delegate **[AuthRequiresCode]** is fired
   The Code collected from the User in the GUI is sent in via this call
*/
void EmailCode(const FString& CodeIn);
/*
   Optional call used to retrieve stored credentials on disk
*/
FStoredCredentials_BE GetStoredCredentials() const;
/*
   Optional call used to check if the credentials on disk are valid or not
*/
bool StoredCredentialsValid();
```

To start you'll want to create a `[UAuthenticator]` UObject like so ```[UAuthenticator * Auth = NewObject<UAuthenticator>()]```, this UObject manages the authentication side of Sequence.

Be sure to bind to the Delegates for **[AuthSuccess]**, **[AuthFailure]**, **[AuthRequiresCode]** prior to making any signin calls You can bind to these delegates like so:
    
```cpp
this->authenticator->AuthRequiresCode.AddDynamic(this, &AYourClass::YourCallReadyToReceiveCode);
this->authenticator->AuthFailure.AddDynamic(this, &AYourClass::YourCallShowAuthFailureScreen);
```
    
In the case of **[AuthSuccess]** since a parameter is also passed we bind to it like this

```cpp
FScriptDelegate del;
del.BindUFunction(this, "CallShowAuthSuccessScreen");
this->authenticator->AuthSuccess.Add(del);
```
    
**Note:** Replace the usage of the `SequenceBackendManager.h/.cpp` with you're own when building a custom GUI, it is only used here as a reference in the event more context is needed with these instructions. Where [CallShowAuthSuccessScreen] is defined in SequenceBackendManager.h as an example like so:

```cpp
UFUNCTION()
void CallShowAuthSuccessScreen(const FCredentials_BE& CredentialsIn);
And in SequenceBackendManager.cpp like so:

void ASequenceBackendManager::CallShowAuthSuccessScreen(const FCredentials_BE& CredentialsIn) 
{
this->Credentials = CredentialsIn;
if (this->ShowAuthSuccessDelegate.IsBound())
  this->ShowAuthSuccessDelegate.Broadcast(Credentials);
else
  UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("**[Nothing bound to: ShowAuthSuccessDelegate]**"));
}  
```

## Email based Authentication With CustomUI

To start email based authentication you'll start it with this call `[EmailLogin(const FString& EmailIn)]`, supplying an email you've collected from the User in your GUI.

Next `[AuthRequiresCode]` will fire when the `[UAuthenticator]` is ready to receive the Code from your UI. Collect this code from your GUI and send it to the authenticator using `[EmailCode(CodeIn)]`.

Finally `[AuthSuccess]` will fire with a `Credentials_BE` struct as a parameter. You are done Email Based Auth.

## Social Signin based Authentication on Desktop With CustomUI

To start **SSO based authentication** with desktop you can either use your own implementation to get the necessary id_token or you can make use of Unreal's web browser plugin.

*Note: Unreal's web browser plugin uses the Chromium embedded browser.*

To get the URL to navigate to you can use the UAuthenticator supplied call `[FString GetSigninURL(const ESocialSigninType& Type)]` where Type is the social login type you wish to use

With whatever implementation you chose you can forward the collected id_token to the UAuthenticator object with `[SocialLogin(const FString& IDTokenIn)]`, after which `[AuthSuccess]` will fire and you're done desktop based SSO.

## Social Signin based Authentication on Mobile With CustomUI

To start mobile SSO you will need to make use of the `[UAuthenticator::InitiateMobileSSO(const ESocialSigninType& Type)]` where type is the Type of SSO you want to use. IE) Google or Apple, for the time being Discord & Facebook aren't supported. This function call is all that's required for Mobile SSO 

### Android SSO Requirements

**Google:** :In order to be able to properly use Google Auth, create and place the Keystore file by following [these instructions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/signing-android-projects-for-release-on-the-google-play-store-with-unreal-engine?application_version=5.1).

You will also need to generate an [Android client ID] and a [Web Application client ID] for your application. And place the [Web Application client ID] in the `[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]`, [GoogleClientID] field.

Refer to [these docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/android/get-started#api-console) to generate [Android client ID] and [Web Application client ID].

[This guide](https://https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth?hl=es-419) helps explain how to collect SHA-1 key fingerprints for the [Android client ID].

**Apple:** Please ensure you have a proper [AppleClientID] set in `[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]`

### IOS SSO Requirements

**Google**: Please ensure you have a proper [GoogleClientID] set in `[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]`

**Apple**: Please ensure you have a proper [AppleClientID] set in `[YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini]`, be sure you register and set your bundle identifier properly for your app

*Apple Specific SSO Requirements*

For Apple SSO to work please be sure to register the [RedirectUrl] in [YourProject/Config/SequenceConfig.ini] appropriately for your app.
