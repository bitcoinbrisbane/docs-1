# Upgrading

## Manually Upgrading from previous versions

If you are using release Beta_1_0_3 or older please backup the values you stored in `PluginConfig/Config.h` or `Config/Config.h`
After you've backed up your configuration data, Delete the entirety of the SequencePlugin directory. And drop
in the new updated version.

### Upgrading to Unreal 5.4

If your project is currently on 5.2 or 5.3, then for this version you'll want to upgrade to 5.4.
1. Close the Unreal Editor and your your Code Editor
2. Right click on your Unreal Project file > "Switch Unreal Engine Version" (you may need to click "Show more options"), choose 5.4 and confirm
3. Open your code editor and rebuild your source code

As a way of future proofing we recommend installing Visual Studio 2022 in accordance with [these docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine) as Unreal 5.4 and onward will be dropping support for Visual Studio 2019.
