# Node Gateway

Sequence Node gateway infrastructure enables you to have fail-over resilient RPC endpoints that can scale with your application.

By using our infrastructure, you save money for not having to deploy your own stack, and benefits from the feature of aggregating multiple public RPC providers into a single endpoint for use.

## Give it a try

Install `ethers` with `pnpm install ethers` or `yarn add ethers`

Ensure to choose a network handle from our [network options](/solutions/technical-references/chain-support)

And acquire a [Sequence Builder access key](https://sequence.build) to authenticate your connection and append to the endpoint

```js
// Import the ethers library
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// Function to create a provider and fetch the latest block
async function getLatestBlock() {
  // Replace the following URL with your actual RPC endpoint
  const rpcUrl =
    "https://nodes.sequence.app/<chain_handle>/<project_access_key>";

  // Create a provider using the RPC URL
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

  // Fetch the latest block
  const latestBlock = await provider.getBlock("latest");

  console.log("Latest Block:", latestBlock);
}

// Call the function to get the latest block
getLatestBlock().catch(console.error);
```
