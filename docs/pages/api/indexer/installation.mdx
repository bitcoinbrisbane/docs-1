# Indexer Installation

:::warning[INTRODUCING THE SEQUENCE BUILDER - https://sequence.build]
Our **Indexer** service is managed through **[Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build)**. Sign up to grab your API access key.

:::

Sequence Indexer is a simple API to query any blockchain token and NFT data. Below are instructions
on how to integrate the Sequence Indexer API into your Webapps, Games, and backends. In case you missed
it, please also see the [Indexer Overview](/api/indexer/overview).

## Installation

The Sequence Indexer is built as a HTTP API with RPC endpoints that you may call directly
from your Webapp, Game or server backend. Below you'll find information on the RPC endpoint
schema with sample curl commands, along with examples in both Javascript/Typescript and Go.

We provide SDKs for [Web / node.js](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js) and [Go](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence).
Or if you'd like to integrate the Indexer with another language target, simply follow the API reference below
to implement the HTTP requests. Additionally, read the Typescript client source code as [reference
implementation of the Indexer API client](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js/blob/master/packages/indexer/src/indexer.gen.ts) as well.

:::info
Sequence Indexer offers the same API across a variety of EVM networks. Make sure to check the Indexer endpoints
and use the corresponding host for your dapp/game. For example, on Ethereum mainnet the Sequence Indexer endpoint is
https://mainnet-indexer.sequence.app and Polygon is https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app.

### Web / node.js Installation

```sh
npm install 0xsequence ethers
```

or

```sh
pnpm install 0xsequence ethers
```

or

```sh
yarn add 0xsequence ethers
```

:::info
This code requires an API Access Key from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build).
:::

```ts
import { SequenceIndexer } from '@0xsequence/indexer'

// see https://docs.sequence.xyz/solutions/technical-references/chain-support for list of
// indexer hosts for the chain you'd like to query
const indexer = new SequenceIndexer('https://mainnet-indexer.sequence.app', 'AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY')

// see examples below for the kinds of queries you can make
const tokenBalances = await indexer.getTokenBalances(...)
```

**NOTE:** if you're using `@0xsequence/indexer` from node.js, we recommend using node v18.x or newer.

<br />

### Go Installation

```bash [Terminal]
go get -u github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence@latest
```

then in your app,

```go [Go]
import (
	"github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence/indexer"
)

// see https://docs.sequence.xyz/solutions/technical-references/chain-support for list of
// indexer hosts for the chain you'd like to query
seqIndexer := indexer.NewIndexer("https://polygon-indexer.sequence.app", "AQAAAAAAAF_JvPALhBthL7VGn6jV0YDqaFY")

// see examples below for the kinds of queries you can make
accountAddress := "ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"
includeMetadata := true
metadataOptions := indexer.MetadataOptions{
	VerifiedOnly: true,
}

_, tokenBalances, err := seqIndexer.GetTokenBalances(context.Background(), &accountAddress, nil, nil, &includeMetadata, &metadataOptions, nil, nil)
```

<br />

### Unity or Unreal Installation

The Sequence Indexer is integrated directly inside of the respective [Sequence Unity](/) and [Sequence Unreal](/) SDKs.
